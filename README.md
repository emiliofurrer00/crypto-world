# CRYPTO-WORLD ðŸš€

![Main Page Screenshot](mainpage.png)

This is a simple web page whose objective is to provide access to the main stats and info around cryptocurrencies and exchanges.
It's still a work-in-progress and receiving constant improvments, so I'm open to any kind of suggestions and constructive criticism!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies used ðŸ’¡

* HTML. CSS && Styled Components;
* Javascript ES6+ && ReactJS;
* React-Redux && @reduxjs/toolkit for API use and hooks;
* React-Icons lib;

## Instalation ðŸ’¾

1. Clone/download the repository

2. Set the working directory to the main folder

3. Execute ```npm install```

4. Happy Hacking! âœ¨

## Scripts (predefined create-react-app ones) ðŸ› 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
